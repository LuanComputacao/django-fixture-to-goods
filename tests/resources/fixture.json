But be aware that too much emotion or exaggeration may make <COWORKERNAME/> uncomfortable."

You may at times feel constrained by the plans <COWORKERNAME/> wants to put in place, while, <COWORKERNAME/> may sometimes think that you get too distracted and need to be more focused on the end result.\n\nWhen working on a project together, be prepared to answer detailed questions about new ideas you introduce, even if they are still in the incubation phase. Tap <COWORKERNAME/>\u2019s planning tendencies to chart a more defined course than you would otherwise set while using your ability to see things from multiple perspectives to help them achieve a fuller understanding of the project."

You may at times feel constrained by the plans <COWORKERNAME/> wants to put in place, while, <COWORKERNAME/> may sometimes think that you get too distracted and need to be more focused on the end result.\n\nWhen working on a project together, be prepared to answer detailed questions about new ideas you introduce, even if they are still in the incubation phase.

With your basic attitude of credulity and idealism, you likely see the good and the human potential in everyone, and you enjoy drawing out the best in people.\n\nMost likely, you relentlessly pursue high ideals, often humanitarian and people-focused. Sometimes you may gloss over or ignore the \u201cdark side,\u201d preferring to anticipate the positive instead of the negative. You may be disappointed when reality doesn\u2019t measure up to your high expectations for human potential.\n\nPlacing a high value on the ethical and moral, you probably want fairness for all, and you have a never-ending desire to make work meaningful. At times, your enthusiasm is dramatically demonstrated with effusive expressions of intense emotion. Your impulsive, dramatic flair is yet another way to heighten the overall awareness of issues that you consider crucial.\n\nLike other ENFJs, you have a high need for developing empathic relationships. These must be deep and meaningful to satisfy your intense desire for rapport. If not given the opportunity to have meaningful relationships, you may become stressed and have difficulties on the job. Since you are so responsive to others, you may lose sight of your own needs or get stuck in the middle of opposing forces. You abhor a lack of caring. For you, an organization exists to enable people to perform\u2014not the other way around.\n\nIntegrity is the hallmark of your relationships. You tend to be authentic and as true to your values as possible. Since you want to avoid being phony, you may resist assignments that require some pretense. Being cast into a role that downplays authenticity may cause you all kinds of grief. Therefore, it\u2019s probably difficult for people to talk you into doing something that\u2019s against your better judgment.\n\nWhen you focus your attention on someone else, your listening skills probably come out second to none. You not only listen, you hear much of what is not said.  Sensitive to nuances and unspoken aspects of communication, you have an unusual capacity to understand other people\u2019s viewpoints. Most likely, you have a sixth sense for how to optimize a conversation and interact with just about anyone. The greater the number and range of people you are able to get to know, the happier you are.\n\nYou tend to find meaning and significance in even the smallest event. Because you are able to make connections between seemingly different things, you may often make inferences that most people miss. Therefore, you tend to know what flows together and what does not, though at times, you may be at a loss in explaining the specifics of \u201cwhy.\u201d Finding meaning and philosophizing probably brings you great joy, and you may tremendously appreciate a good discussion on just about anything, as long as it does not turn sour or unfriendly.\n\n<NAME/>, like others with the ENFJ type, your most valuable contributions to the workplace may include your empathy, cooperative spirit, warmth, graciousness, and keen listening and communication skills.

When this happens, you\u2019re much more likely to feel pity rather than anger toward the individual at fault. You see things as they should be in a perfect world, so it may be quite difficult for you to accept your and others\u2019 limitations. Consequently, you may have a fluctuating self-image as you struggle to live up to your own ideals. \n\nFurthermore, you may often find yourself taking on others\u2019 troubles as your own, as long as their troubles aren\u2019t in violation of your core values. When you have empathy for another, you may become overly involved in fixing the person\u2019s problems and stretch yourself too thin. At times, you may be seen as agreeing with each person you relate to and get stuck between opposing forces. However, you avoid conflict and hurting people\u2019s feelings. This may mean holding on to unworthy relationships and turning a blind eye to character flaws that undermine your idea of someone. \n\nFinally, such empathy also gives way to sensitivity, particularly to criticism. You respond well to praise, but you may be deeply hurt by disapproval. And, if you become overly flustered or upset, you may be prone to anger or overreacting in a seemingly irrational manner. ",

You can be very effusive in the way you express yourself, and those who are more straight-faced may think you\u2019re being over-the-top when you\u2019re really just trying to bring awareness to an issue.

As such, you have an ability to balance projects and can not only get lost in the moment while working on a project but can also bounce around a lot, tackling different projects throughout the day.

In a similar vein, you may not be afraid to ask for help or to rely on others.

As such, you may have a tendency to speak first and then think later. Additionally, you may bounce from topic to topic.

You\u2019re not much for planning. It\u2019s not that you forget to plan; you really just don\u2019t like it.

Some environments, where things happen on many different levels at one time, may be stressful for you.\n\nWhile you don\u2019t usually take the first step in defining relationships and bringing people together, a sense of belonging is probably important to you. You also want to preserve traditions and appreciate the value of rituals, ceremonies, and celebrations in providing a sense of permanence in the organization. In fact, if there is an absence of traditions, you may be the one to create them.\n\nLike other ISTJs, you want an orderly, stable work environment where your tasks are clearly defined. It\u2019s probably important to you to have a sense that life and business will go on as usual in a predictable, constant sort of way. To that end, you tend to be efficient and prefer things to be on time and on schedule. You likely keep a routine and work with steady energy, and you may lose patience with people who do not operate this way.\n\nBeing responsible is also very important to you since it is a pathway to stability. Not only do you thrive on responsibility, you rarely turn down opportunities to take on more. In fact, you may have trouble saying no and end up overloaded. Furthermore, it may be difficult for you to delegate any of your work unless you have a great deal of confidence that the other person will complete the task according to your standards.\n\nIt\u2019s also crucial to your sense of stability that your organization thrive, so you can be counted on to complete all assignments and follow through. To be sure that the goal is achieved, you tend to be cooperative, as long as the interest of the organization is at heart. Because you are so dedicated to getting the job done and tend to be loyal to your team, you may even undertake tasks that no one else wants to do for the good of the team.\n\nYou probably have a capacity for attention to detail and gathering facts. Most likely, you can handle complex figures and make sense out of them with ease. Since you tend to excel at measurement, you have an ability to accurately budget or allocate quantities and tend to be skilled at anything having to do with logistics.

To you, facts are facts, and you may not have much respect for people who ignore or are ignorant of them. You expect people to be logical, too, in much the same way as you are. Others may view such an objective stance as impersonal and cold. At the same time, since you are so detailed and rely so heavily on evidential proof, it may be difficult for you to accept when you\u2019ve made a mistake, and you may be particularly hard on yourself for it. \n\nFurthermore, you like to do things by the book and may be unwilling to bend the rules, even if it could benefit the situation or the people involved. You believe that policies and regulations are in place for a reason, to the point where you may not be responsive to the need for change. Moreover, there may be times when you\u2019d rather not learn new procedures, having mastered the ones you are accustomed to. \n\nFinally, you are eager for responsibility and, at times, you may take on too much.

It\u2019s likely you believe in procedure, but this doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re rigid. You respect tried-and-true methods and guidelines.

For you, though, fewer close relationships are far preferable to many surface-level relationships. With others, you make it a priority to find ways to connect and perform small acts of kindness. Overall, you like to interact with others and look for relationships that are both stable and peaceful.\n\nWhen working with others, you try hard to meet everyone\u2019s expectations. And because you feel responsible to those around you, you\u2019ll probably go out of your way to make others happy. You may, however, sometimes feel like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders, even while you\u2019re downplaying the duties you\u2019re taking on.\n\nWhen it comes to change, you like having ample time to adjust; big, upcoming changes may stress you out a little. Similarly, when change does occur, it may take you more time than others to get accustomed to your new settings. When there is a lot going on, you may feel overwhelmed and, possibly, prone to sensory overload. Ultimately, this reflects your strong need for stability. Therefore, you may feel most at home in a quiet and controlled environment.\n\n<NAME/>, like others with the ISFJ type, your humility, altruism, and supportive nature are things that bring great value to your workplace and to those who interact with you daily. Your appreciation for cooperative environments and your willingness to buckle down and do the work for the good of the team are likely assets that you bring to the workplace.",

    "blind_spots": "As an ISFJ, you have many assets, but you may also have some potential blind spots. These are the aspects of our personalities that we\u2019re not even really aware of but that may seem quite obvious to the people around us. As is described below, many of our strengths have accompanying pitfalls. \n\nLike other ISFJs, you tend to be humble, often downplaying your success. Most likely, you\u2019re more concerned with others than yourself, especially when it comes to those closest to you, and you\u2019ll place their needs above your own. It\u2019s probably quite difficult for you to say \u201cno\u201d to people, and all of this may cause you to become overloaded and to eventually burn out. \n\nFurthermore, you may be particularly sensitive to criticism, but, at times, you can be your own biggest faultfinder. If someone says something to you that really bothers you, you may hold your hurt feelings inside, which could lead to internal melancholy or pent-up resentment. You\u2019re also sensitive to how others might feel, and you\u2019re unlikely to confront or critique someone, even if it could really help them in some way. \n\nFinally, you don\u2019t particularly like change and may be dubbed as \u201cset in your ways,\u201d even if you\u2019re not vocal about it. If something is working, you see no reason to change it. You\u2019re focused on creating stability, and you may continue with the procedures and traditions that are in place beyond their utility. ",

And though it happens to everyone, it still feels a difficult cross to bear. Because deep down, we want people to understand and accept us, and certainly not to make incorrect assumptions about our character.\n\nBeing a \u201cgoody two shoes\u201d or a \u201cyes man\u201d may be misconceptions about ISFJs. While it\u2019s true that you tend to follow the rules and are loyal to your superiors, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re unwilling to stand up for yourself. While you stay on the straight and narrow partly to please others, you also do so because you have a strong conscience. Furthermore, you\u2019re likely observant of the past and highly aware of the consequences of deviance. You aren\u2019t a doormat; you just want to do the right thing and stay out of trouble.\n\nAt the extreme, ISFJs may be misperceived as \u201clacking depth,\u201d when this isn\u2019t the case at all. Since you tend to be quiet and obedient, you may often be overshadowed by others. However, you likely have very strong opinions, even if you don\u2019t express them, and intense feelings, though you appreciate your privacy. While some people may regard you as just another friendly face or worker bee, what they miss is the profound complexity you possess inside.",

Being very perceptive of others\u2019 motives, you tend to be interested in what\u2019s going on around you. You probably want to inspire others as much as you want to be inspired, and you may have a contagious enthusiasm for \u201ccauses.\u201d\n\nMost likely, you are people-oriented and skilled at anything having to do with interacting. You may operate in a very personal way, seeking relationships and spending untold hours on interpersonal intrigues. At times, your concern for other people\u2019s problems might draw you off task and you might become overwhelmed by your self-assigned responsibility of harmonizing the lives of others.\n\nIntegrity is likely very important to you, and your sometimes uncompromising values and needs may conflict with company policies. While you are very loyal, your loyalty goes to the people in the organization and not so much to the systems and procedures.\n\nLike other ENFPs, you abhor a lack of caring and appreciate the \u201chuman side\u201d of the enterprise. You likely have a strongly held belief that everyone is obligated to care for everyone else. Often identifying with others to the point of demonstrating perfect empathy, you seem to know just what a person needs in order to function better. This ability to identify so strongly with others may put some strain on your own identity at times. You can become so dedicated to supporting others that you put your own needs and wants second. It\u2019s sometimes only later that you regret your impulsive generosity.\n\nYour basic attitude is one of credulity, enthusiasm, and idealism. Since you usually expect goodness, you tend to see the potential in everyone and everything. Enthusiasm on your part is usually demonstrated with effusive expressions of intense emotions, and your optimism can be quite contagious. On the other hand, you may be rather disappointed when \u201creality\u201d doesn\u2019t measure up to your idealistic expectations.\n\nWarmth, graciousness, and charm are likely natural aspects of your communication style. You tend to think with imagery, and you are particularly gifted in reporting and rephrasing events so they become more illuminating, interesting, and valuable. Furthermore, you are sensitive to the nuances and unspoken aspects of communication, and you are often focused on implications and hidden agendas. And, since you are so concerned with human needs, you also tend to be a superb listener. One of your greatest joys is getting lost in conversation with another person.\n\nHaving variety in what you do is important to you. You frequently invent new ways of doing things and are masterful at \u201cspur of the moment\u201d activities, especially when they involve interacting with people. As a result, you may become fragmented from wanting to do too many different things all at once and from being pulled in too many directions, seeking to please everyone.\n\n<NAME/>, like others with the ENFP type, your most valuable contributions to the workplace may include your warmth, enthusiasm, authenticity, capacity to inspire, and penchant for unveiling and disclosing information. In fact, these are probably some of the qualities that others admire most about you.",

You are likely interested in so many things that it\u2019s hard to narrow them down. Often, you will zero in on a project only to abandon it when another shiny, new opportunity comes along. Following through may be difficult for you, so you\u2019ll often start more things than you finish. Similarly, since you\u2019re always open to new possibilities, you may have trouble committing to decisions and wind up leaving things until the last minute. \n\nFurthermore, you\u2019re prone to improvisation and you tend to be quite impulsive. It\u2019s not up your alley to do a lot of planning, which may lead you to jump to conclusions or make errors in judgment. You\u2019re probably always thinking about what could be, sometimes overlooking the value of what\u2019s actually in front of you. While you\u2019re enthusiastic about your endeavors, you may not always be realistic. Mundane upkeep and detailed tasks may be best left to another. \n\nFinally, you may be a popular person for others to lean on. However, you sometimes get so caught up in helping others that you neglect your own needs and responsibilities. And since you may be overly concerned with being liked, criticism or disapproval may be very upsetting for you, giving way to defensive outbursts. ",

While some people may incorrectly assume you\u2019re directionless or disinterested, you\u2019re often just on the hunt for a new discovery. And, when you\u2019re passionate about something, you have no trouble honing in on what\u2019s important. \n\nAt the extreme, some people may think ENFPs are \u201cmanipulators.\u201d It\u2019s true that you can be very persuasive, but your intent isn\u2019t malicious. You\u2019re probably exceptional when it comes to communicating your feelings and ideas in a way that compels people to see things from your point of view. You may often find that you can motivate people into doing things or switching gears. However, you likely have a strong moral code, so you use your power of persuasiveness for good instead of evil.

You\u2019re probably happiest when solving complex problems, and if you aren\u2019t given the opportunity to do so in your work, you may find others\u2019 problems to fix. While you are happy working independently, you\u2019re pragmatic and want to do whatever it takes to get the job done, including collaborating with others.\n\nYou tend to be future-oriented and an abstract thinker, making you an avid strategist. You relish the process of planning and designing, though you may get more enjoyment out of the planning than the doing since you want to avoid routine.\n\nSocial conventions and small talk may not be high on your priority list. Rather, you have a preference for logic and reasoning and may not be as comfortable handling emotional interpersonal situations.\n\nBecause you trust logical reasoning above all else, you may be turned off by exaggeration and overly emotional responses. Because of this, you might appear somewhat aloof or cold to some, but you are simply searching for the rationale behind decisions and approaches. To that end, you aren\u2019t afraid to reject and challenge anything you believe has been inaccurately presented.\n\nThough you may not leap to take the lead in every situation, you\u2019re more likely to do so when you feel you have some authority. Given that you have an almost insatiable thirst for knowledge, you probably consider yourself an expert in certain areas.\n\nLike other INTPs, you probably abhor redundancy and hesitate to state the obvious, so your communications are frequently terse and you may assume you are understood. On the other hand, when asked to explain something, you may become quite technical with many details and much complexity.  In fact, because you are a keen wordsmith, you are able to express with great precision exactly what you mean.\n\nYou love taking things apart and putting them back together, whether machinery, ideas, or processes. You expect things to be orderly and logical, and you don\u2019t hesitate to question and go back to the drawing board, picking apart your own designs as much as others\u2019.
